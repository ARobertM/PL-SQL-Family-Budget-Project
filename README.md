# PL-SQL-Family-Budget-Project
  I created this repository to start a new project in PL/SQL in order to develop my knowledge of this language and to better understand the concepts behind it.
  A project is presented to save some families to get back to a favorable financial goal to support themselves and have a long life without fear of tomorrow.
  The names and dates in this project are completely random and is used strictly in an academic way to learn.
